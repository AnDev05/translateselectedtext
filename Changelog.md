## v0.7.2 ##
  * Added support for 10 new languages.

## v0.7.1 ##
  * The settings page now has a refreshed look which adds the ability to rearrange the order of languages in the context menu.
  * The settings page now features a "Credits" link in the top right corner which features the projects which made possible the development of this extension.

## v0.6.2 ##
  * Russian translation added. Many thanks to **Alexander Simkin** for translating the extension UI!
  * When only one language is selected to translate into, now the Chrome's context menu only includes a "Translate selection into '{{language}}'" item.
  * Bug fixes.

## v0.6.1.1 ##
  * When using the app for the first time the language of the Chrome interface is automatically included in the translate context menu.

  * Bug fixes.

## v0.6: ##
  * Settings are now synced across all your devices! (as requested by some users)
  * Whenever the extension updates a notification will appear with a summary of the changes so the user doesn't get confused.

## v0.5.2 ##
  * Added an experimental feature that will be further developed in the future: open Google Translator in panels.

## v0.5 ##
  * New branding! Now we use a custom icon taken from the fabulous "Metro Uinvert Dock Icon Set" created by dAKirby309 and available in http://dakirby309.deviantart.com/art/Metro-Uinvert-Dock-Icon-Set-725-Icons-294529071

## v0.4.2 ##
  * Now when translating text and you have already opened a translation tab of the extension in another window, the focus will go to the other window and also to the tab (before it only focused the tab, but not the window).
  * Fixed some ortographic mistakes in the catalan version.

## v0.4.1 ##
Mainly minor changes:
  * Users can now choose to open the translator page in a unique tab and replace the previous translation or open different tabs.
  * Now a "close" button is showed in the options page.
  * Now the options page explicitly says that options are saved automatically. (Thanks for the last two suggestions Jan!)

## v0.4 ##
  * First Release in the CWS
