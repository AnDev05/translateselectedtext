The "Translate Selected Text" extension is available in two versions/channels which are available to download from the Chrome Web Store, but what's the difference between the two channels?

## Stable channel ##
It's the default channel. As the name says, it is stable, which means that the extension is tested and is fully functional.

## Beta channel ##
Before passing onto the stable channel, each version first is uploaded to the beta channel so beta testers can use the app, and bugs can be discovered before the version is published to the stable channel. Therefore, if you use this channel, you may come across bugs and you may find the extension unusable at all, although you will be able to test and use the new functions before anybody else.

## Load from source ##
Apart from the stable and beta versions uploaded to the Chrome Web Store, you can always download the source code and load the source code of the extension into Chrome to test the latest of the latest. To do so, follow the following steps:

  1. Get a local copy of the source code by [downloading](https://code.google.com/p/translateselectedtext/source/browse/) a .zip or .tar.gz archive and extracting it or run this Git command: `git clone https://code.google.com/p/translateselectedtext/`
  1. Open the `chrome://extensions` page in Chrome.
  1. Check the **_Developer Mode_** checkmark in the upper right corner of the page.
  1. Click on **_Load unpacked extension..._**
  1. Select the folder where the extension source code is located.
