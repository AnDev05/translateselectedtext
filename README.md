## Special thanks
Special thanks to:
* All the users who use the extension every day and who trust the model of developing simple extensions which do not request any privacy-breaking permissions.
* Alexander Simkin for the Russian translation.
* BrowserStack for allowing me to use their awesome services in order to test the extension in multiple versions of Chrome and in different operating systems.
